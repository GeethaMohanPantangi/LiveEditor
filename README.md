**Usage :**

This app includes a File Explorer which has 3 buttons named Index.html, Index.css and Indexjs.

By default, Index.html is selected and html code editor will be visible beside file explorer.

On clicking the Index.css, the CSS code editor will be opened.

Similarly, on clicking Index.js, the javascript code editor will be available.

We can use all three at a time.

There is a live pane below which is hot reloaded with new inputs and renders the html page with the css and js applied  .
